You are a READ-ONLY inventory agent. Your job is to enumerate every AI coding harness file in the current project. All relative paths below resolve against your working directory.

Scan and list the FULL CONTENT of:
1. CLAUDE.md
2. Every AGENTS.md file found in this repository (run: find . -name "AGENTS.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*")
3. \${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/settings.json (if exists)
4. .claude/settings.json (if exists)
5. Every file under \${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/skills/ (list filenames + first 30 lines each)
6. Every file under .claude/skills/ (list filenames + first 30 lines each)
7. Every file under \${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/workflows/ (list filenames + first 30 lines each)
8. Every file under .claude/workflows/ (list filenames + first 30 lines each)
9. .cursor/rules/ in this project (if exists, list all files)
10. .cursor/rules/ in the user's home directory (if exists, list all files)

You are the GLOBAL CONTEXT TAX AGENT. Your job: analyze files that load into EVERY session and assess whether they impose unnecessary context cost.

Context: This is an audit of the current project. Read these files yourself; relative paths resolve against your working directory.

Files to analyze (read them):
- CLAUDE.md
- Every AGENTS.md in this repository (find with: find . -name "AGENTS.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*")
- Any cursor rules in .cursor/rules/ in this project or in the user's home directory

Audit principles:
- Good global context = universal invariants that CANNOT be in a skill (e.g., "never commit secrets", repo architecture map)
- Bad global context = things that only matter for specific tasks (e.g., "when writing tests, do X"), procedural how-to's that belong in skills, historical decisions that are now obvious from the code itself
- Warning signs: very long AGENTS.md files (>100 lines), duplicated guidance across CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md, guidance that references specific tool names/versions that may have changed, "best practices" lists that the LLM already knows

For each file section that is problematic, output a finding block:
---FINDING---
PATH: <file path>
SECTION: <section name or line range>
CURRENT_PURPOSE: <what it currently does>
PROBLEM: <why it's bloat/legacy/duplicate>
EVIDENCE: <specific quote or line that shows the problem>
RECOMMENDATION: KEEP | SHRINK | MOVE | SPLIT | CONVERT | DELETE
RISK_IF_REMOVED: low | medium | high
CONFIDENCE: low | medium | high
AUTO_PROCESSABLE: yes | no
---END---

After all findings, output a SUMMARY section with:
- Total lines analyzed across all global context files
- Estimated % that is "always-needed" vs "task-specific" vs "historical"
- Top 3 biggest opportunities to reduce global context load
`, { label: 'global-context-tax', phase: 'Parallel Analysis' }),

  () => agent(`
You are the SKILL QUALITY AGENT. Your job: audit every skill file for quality, necessity, scope, AND structural quality.

Read all skill files from:
- \${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/skills/ (use find + read each file)
- .claude/skills/ in this project (use find + read each file)

For each skill, evaluate:
1. NECESSITY: Is this skill still needed? Or has Claude Code/Cursor built this in natively?
2. TRIGGER SCOPE: Is the trigger description too broad? (e.g., "use when writing any code" is too broad)
3. LENGTH: Is the skill file too long (>200 lines)? Could it be split into a reference doc + a short procedure?
4. DUPLICATION: Does this skill overlap significantly with another skill or with CLAUDE.md?
5. FRESHNESS: Are there references to specific versions, dates, deprecated APIs, or workflows that no longer exist?
6. INVOCATION PATTERN: Is this skill "rigid" (must be followed exactly) or "flexible" (principles)? Is the type appropriate?

STRUCTURAL QUALITY SIGNALS (authoring:skill-check Check 1/2/3/6/12 — these directly drive
the "should this skill be refactored?" decision). The SSOT is the
\`authoring:skill-check\` skill's own \`references/checks.md\`, which defines each
check on a PASS/WARN/FAIL scale; this harness collapses that to a binary signal.
MAPPING RULE: apply the SSOT criteria as written, then report any SSOT WARN OR
FAIL as FAIL here (only a clean SSOT PASS maps to PASS). Do NOT invent new
criteria — only the WARN→FAIL collapse is the harness-specific simplification.
Evaluate ONLY these five (Check 4/5/7/8/9/10/11 are out of scope for this
harness — they remain /authoring:skill-check-only):

- Check 1 — Line Count: SSOT PASS (≤ 100 lines) → PASS; SSOT WARN (101–150) or FAIL (> 150) → FAIL.
- Check 2 — Progressive Disclosure: SSOT PASS (workflow phases in SKILL.md, detail
  in references/) → PASS; SSOT WARN (some inline templates/tables) or FAIL (large
  reference content embedded inline) → FAIL.
- Check 3 — Frontmatter Validity: SSOT PASS (valid; BOTH \`name\` and \`description\`,
  only known attributes) → PASS; SSOT WARN (minor issues) or FAIL (missing fields /
  unknown attributes) → FAIL.
- Check 6 — Help Flag Pattern: SSOT PASS (\`-h\`/\`--help\`/\`help\` → reads
  references/help.md verbatim, no API calls) → PASS; SSOT WARN (inline/non-verbatim
  help) or FAIL (no help support) → FAIL.
- Check 12 — Model Recommendation Metadata: SSOT PASS (valid \`tier\` + \`reason\` +
  compatibility) → PASS; SSOT WARN/FAIL (missing fields, disallowed tier, or absent)
  → FAIL; SSOT N/A (\`disable-model-invocation: true\`) → PASS (no metadata required).

A FAIL on any of these five RAISES the skill's refactor priority. The more
structural FAILs, the higher the refactor priority.

For each skill file, output:
---SKILL---
NAME: <skill name>
PATH: <file path>
LINE_COUNT: <approximate>
CURRENT_PURPOSE: <one sentence>
STRUCTURAL_QUALITY: Check1:PASS|FAIL Check2:PASS|FAIL Check3:PASS|FAIL Check6:PASS|FAIL Check12:PASS|FAIL
STRUCTURAL_FAIL_COUNT: <number of the five checks that FAILed>
PROBLEMS:
  - <problem 1>
  - <problem 2>
RECOMMENDATION: KEEP | SHRINK | SPLIT | CONVERT | DELETE
REFACTOR_PRIORITY: high | medium | low  (raise when STRUCTURAL_FAIL_COUNT is high)
RISK_IF_CHANGED: low | medium | high
CONFIDENCE: low | medium | high
AUTO_PROCESSABLE: yes | no
---END---

After all skills, output:
- TOP 5 skills with the highest "shrink" or "delete" potential
- Skills with the most structural FAILs (highest refactor priority)
- Any skills that could be converted to reference.md or examples.md docs instead
- Skills with overlapping triggers that should be merged

You are the SAFETY AND PERMISSION AGENT. Your job: audit hooks, allowed-tools permissions, and MCP configurations for excessive or stale grants.

Read these files (READ ONLY — do not modify):

- .claude/settings.json

- Any .claude/settings.json in subdirectories (find . -name "settings.json" -path "*claude*")
- Check for any .mcp.json or mcp config files

Evaluate:
1. ALLOWED_TOOLS: Are any tool permissions granted too broadly? (e.g., "Bash(*)" grants all shell access)
2. HOOKS: Do any hooks run destructive commands? Are hooks still needed or does native Claude Code behavior replace them?
3. MCP SERVERS: Are all configured MCP servers still active and necessary? Any with write/delete access that should be read-only?
4. PERMISSION SCOPE: Is the principle of least privilege being followed?

1. What is the WORST CASE if this rule disappears? (What mistake does it currently prevent?)
2. Is this rule compensating for a known real incident or repeated mistake? (Evidence: git history, comments, docs)
