# harness:plugin-guide — Plugin Guide Generator

## Help

If arg #1 is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and output
its content verbatim, then stop. No file reads/writes.

## Step 1: Parse Args

Positional: `<plugin-name> [output-root] [--force]`.

| Arg | Description | Default | Required |
|-----|-------------|---------|----------|
| `<plugin-name>` | `<plugin>@<marketplace>` or `<plugin>` alone | — | Yes |
| `[output-root]` | Directory the guide and its index live in | `docs/guide/plugins` | No |
| `--force` | Regenerate even if the target doc already exists | off | No |

Split `<plugin-name>` on `@` into `PLUGIN` and (optional) `MARKETPLACE`.
The output filename is always `PLUGIN.md`. Missing arg → print
`Run /harness:plugin-guide -h for usage.` and stop.
Set `OUT` = `[output-root]` (create it if absent), `CFG=${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}`.

## Step 2: Verify Installed (F-2)

Resolve `MARKETPLACE` by exact-matching `PLUGIN@` against the keys of
`$CFG/plugins/installed_plugins.json`'s `plugins` object — **never** substring
`grep` (a plugin named `skills` would falsely match `example-skills@...`). Zero,
one, or 2+ matches (e.g. `superpowers` is installed under two marketplaces
today) are each handled per `references/marketplace-resolution.md`, which also
covers the not-installed case when `MARKETPLACE` itself is unknown.

## Step 3: Locate Cache + Enumerate Skills (F-3)

```bash
find "$CFG/plugins/cache/<MARKETPLACE>/<PLUGIN>" -maxdepth 4 -iname SKILL.md
```

If multiple version dirs exist, keep only the highest (`sort -V` on the
version path component). Zero `SKILL.md` found → this is the **no-skills error
case**: report `스킬 없음, 문서화 대상 아님` and stop. That cache is Claude-Code-only;
for every other harness see the repo-root `references/*-tools.md`.

If skill count > 10, print ONE warning line
(`스킬 N개 (>10) — YAGNI: 단일 파일로 생성`) and continue with a single file.
Do NOT build subdirectory-splitting logic.

For each `SKILL.md`, read frontmatter `name`/`description` and skim the body for
its one core rule → a 1-2 line "하는 일" summary (see `references/doc-template.md`).

## Step 4: Idempotent Skip (Acceptance: safe re-run)

If `$OUT/<PLUGIN>.md` already exists and `--force` was NOT passed:
print `이미 문서화됨 — 재생성하려면 --force` and stop. Do NOT diff or merge
sections. `--force` overwrites the file wholesale.

## Step 5: Write the Doc (F-4, F-6)

Write `$OUT/<PLUGIN>.md` in **Korean**, following the exact
3-section skeleton in `references/doc-template.md` (설치 방법 → 스킬 설명 →
사용법 예제). SKILL.md sources are English — summarize, don't copy prose.

## Step 6: Update Index (F-5)

Insert one line inside the `## Index` list in `$OUT/README.md` — after the last
existing `- [...]` item and **before** the next `## ` header (e.g. `## 문서 구성`);
never blindly append to end-of-file:
`- [<PLUGIN>](./<PLUGIN>.md) — <one-line Korean summary>`. **Idempotent**: if a
line already links `./<PLUGIN>.md`, skip. Create `$OUT/README.md` with an
`## Index` heading if it does not exist yet.

## Step 7: Report

Print the report per `references/help.md` "출력 형식": `[OK]` verdict, files
written/skipped, skill count, and the next step (review the doc, then commit
manually — this skill never commits).

## Constraints

- Never install plugins / run `/plugin install` (F-2 stops for the user), never
  commit or open a PR (Non-Goal), never smoke-test skills (out of scope).
- Generated docs are Korean (docs/AGENTS.md Language Policy); the SKILL.md
  sources stay English — do not confuse the two. No emojis anywhere.
